### Introduction
In this project, we aim to generalize the use of winding number into multi-dimensional graphs, utilizing it's nature of segmenting spacial regions, and introducing it as a new feature of spacial segmentation task.
We performed semi-supervised learning on a partially labeled graph with multi-dimensional winding number features generated by different strategies of assigning stroke (i.e. connections between oppositely labelled objects in some learned embedding space) orientations. 
With different assignments on orientations of strokes, we obtained various topology structures on the graph, which gives us multiple winding number features for each point on the graph. 
Finally, we performed multi-region segmentation on an embedding space and test winding number's reliability as a feature to predict with.

### How to run

##### Prepare environments
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Generate graph
```
python graph.py
```
```
usage: graph.py [-h] [--hard] [-c CATEGORIES] [-n POINTS] [-k KNN_K] [-t TRAIN_RATIO]

options:

  --hard
  -c CATEGORIES, --categories CATEGORIES
                        Number of categories for the graph splitter
  -n POINTS, --points POINTS
                        Number of points to generate
  -k KNN_K, --knn_k KNN_K
                        K value for KNN
  -t TRAIN_RATIO, -r TRAIN_RATIO, --train_ratio TRAIN_RATIO
